1. What happens if users choose “Cancel”?
Because the option variable is set to JOptionPane.CANCEL_OPTION, the check if option is equal to JOptionPane.OK_OPTION will return false, and the program will print “You've chosen: No”. To fix this, the program can check additionally check if option is equal to JOptionPane.CANCEL_OPTION and, as the repository suggests, exit with code 1.

2. How to customize the options to users, e.g. only two options: “Yes” and “No”, OR “I do” and “I don’t”
To customize the options, the program can use the showOptionDialog with the following parameters:
- parentComponent: null
- message: "Do you want to change to the first class ticket?"
- title: "Choose an option"
- optionType: JOptionPane.YES_NO_OPTION
- messageType: JOptionPane.QUESTION_MESSAGE
- icon: null
- options: new Object[] {"I do", "I don't"}
- initialValue: 0
This will create a dialog with only two options: "I do" and "I don't".
