1. If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does Java allow you to do this?

Answer: Yes, Java allows you to create multiple constructors in a class. The constructors must have different parameters. The constructors are differentiated by the number of parameters or the data type of the parameters.

2. Is Java a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language? (Already answered in the PDF)

Answer: Java is a pass by value programming language. In Java, the actual parameter is passed to the method. The method receives a copy of the actual parameter. The changes made to the parameter inside the method do not affect the actual parameter.

3. After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?

Answer: The title of the two objects remains the same because Java is a pass by value programming language. When the swap method is called, the references to the objects are passed by value. Therefore, any changes made to the references inside the swap method do not affect the original references outside the method.

4. After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?

Answer: The title of the JungleDVD is changed because the changeTitle method takes a reference to the object as a parameter. When the method is called, the reference to the jungleDVD object is passed, and any changes made to the title inside the method affect the original object.

5. Which classes are aggregates of other classes?
Answer:

CompactDisc:
   - Aggregates Track objects.
   - The tracks list is initialized in the class, and methods like addTrack and removeTrack manage the Track objects.

Book:
   - Aggregates String objects representing authors.
   - The authors list is initialized in the class, and methods like addAuthor and removeAuthor manage the authors.

Cart:
   - Aggregates Media objects.
   - The itemsOrdered list is initialized in the class, and methods like addMedia and removeMedia manage the Media objects.

Store:
   - Aggregates Media objects.
   - The itemsInStore list is initialized in the class, and methods like addMedia and removeMedia manage the Media objects.
