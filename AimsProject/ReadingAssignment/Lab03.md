## What are the advantages of Polymorphism?
- Code Reusability: Polymorphism allows for the use of a single interface to represent different data types, which can lead to more reusable code.
- Flexibility: It allows for the implementation of different behaviors for the same method in different classes, making the code more flexible and easier to extend.
- Maintainability: Polymorphism can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code, as it reduces the need for complex conditional statements and allows for easier updates and changes.
- Abstraction: It allows for the creation of abstract classes and interfaces, which can help to hide implementation details and provide a clear separation between interface and implementation.
- Dynamic Binding: Polymorphism enables dynamic binding, which allows for the decision of which method to call to be made at runtime, leading to more efficient and optimized code execution.

## How is Inheritance useful to achieve Polymorphism in Java?
- Inheritance allows for the creation of a hierarchy of classes, where a subclass can inherit properties and methods from a superclass.
- This allows for the creation of a common interface or abstract class that can be used to define a set of methods that must be implemented by all subclasses.
- When a subclass overrides a method from its superclass, it can provide its own implementation of that method, allowing for different behaviors for the same method name in different classes.

## What are the differences between Polymorphism and Inheritance in Java?
- Inheritance is a mechanism for creating a new class based on an existing class, while polymorphism is a concept that allows for the use of a single interface to represent different data types.
- Inheritance is a static relationship between classes, while polymorphism is a dynamic relationship that allows for different behaviors at runtime.
- Inheritance is used to create a hierarchy of classes, while polymorphism is used to allow for the use of a single interface to represent different data types.
- Inheritance is a way to achieve code reuse, while polymorphism is a way to achieve flexibility and maintainability in code.
