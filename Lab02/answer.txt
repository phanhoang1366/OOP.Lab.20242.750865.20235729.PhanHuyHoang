1. If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does Java allow you to do this?

Answer: Yes, Java allows you to create multiple constructors in a class. The constructors must have different parameters. The constructors are differentiated by the number of parameters or the data type of the parameters.

2. Is Java a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language? (Already answered in the PDF)

Answer: Java is a pass by value programming language. In Java, the actual parameter is passed to the method. The method receives a copy of the actual parameter. The changes made to the parameter inside the method do not affect the actual parameter.
